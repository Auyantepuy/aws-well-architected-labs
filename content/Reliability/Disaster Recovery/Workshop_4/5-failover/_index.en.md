When a regional service event affects the Unishop application in the primary region **N. Virginia (us-east-1)**, we want to fail over to the secondary region **N. California (us-west-1)**.

{{% notice note %}}
We will **manually** perform a series of tasks to failover our workload to our secondary region **N. California (us-west-1)**.  
In a production environment, we would **automate** these tasks as part of our failover process.

#### Simulating a Regional Service Event

We will now simulate a regional service event affecting the Unishop website in **N. Virginia (us-east-1)**.  We are going to achieve this by blocking public access to the S3 bucket that is hosting the website making the Unishop website unavailable.

1.1 Click [S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#/) to navigate to the dashboard.

1.2 Click on the **hot-primary-uibucket-xxxx** link.

1.3 Click the **Permissions** link. In the **Block public access (bucket settings)** section, click the **Edit** button.

1.4 Enable the **Block all public access** checkbox, then click the **Save** button.

1.5 Type `confirm`, then click the **Confirm** button.

1.6 Click the **Properties** link.

1.7 In the **Static website hosting** section.  Click on the **Bucket website endpoint** link.

1.8  You should get a **403 Forbidden** error.

{{% notice info %}}
Your Amazon S3 bucket that hosts the Hot-Primary website is now inaccessible.  When CloudFront attempts to route the userâ€™s request to the primary region, it will receive an HTTP 403 status error (Forbidden).  The Distribution will automatically handle this scenario by failing over to the Hot-Secondary region.
