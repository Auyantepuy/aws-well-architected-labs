If you go back and refresh your browser (using the CloudFront Distribution’s Domain Name from before), you should now see **The Unicorn Shop - us-west-1** website. You might need to do a hard-page refresh (using CTRL+F5).  The user’s session should still be active, and their cart still contains the products previously added.
